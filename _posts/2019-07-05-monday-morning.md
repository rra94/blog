I lie awake and dream of shoelaces   
With multicolored strings intertwined   
Of canvas with cherub faces   
And your toes touching mine  

I turn my head in your direction   
The sun a halo around your head   
My fingers search for some connection   
On the farther side of my bed  

They grab but the cold sheet   
Golden silk feels like straw   
Grey blankets coil around my feet   
My Head’s stuck in in a feathery maw  

I open my eyes and the room stops spinning   
Bruised pages emit Arabic smells   
The smug clock face can’t stop grinning   
With unread words my cellphones swells  

I seal my eyes shut again   
Hoping to catch another fleeing smile   
As you swim the seas of Spain   
Off and away from my isle
