A Dandelion rises from below, Gaia's child  
and soothes my cracked heels  
as I walk home on burdened shoulders    
Greeted by vibrant soldiers growing wild   


Sometimes I lay down, legs outstretched  
on dew-laden leaves of green  
tired of the day, back a wreck  
Against my neck, a blue flower leans  

I wish the grass would grow taller  
cover me whole, Earth take me in  
As the sun sets and stars assemble  
till the moon resembles a silver pin  

Let the worms feast on my mortal suit   
take back all I have taken  
for I'm a leech that keeps on sucking   
blood intoxicating, as the piper's flute  

Once they're done, let me remain  
in my brown blanket of solitude  
with strangers and lovers long forgotten   
was life, now rotten, under thy eternal reign  

Let me become a dandelion  
Holding my head up in the sun   
For they too will walk along soon   
on a spring afternoon, my fellow dandelions
