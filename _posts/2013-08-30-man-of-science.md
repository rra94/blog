He had it with a PhD degree,  
A man of science by decree.  
fed up of Epsilon-delta, apogee perigee  
wanted to commit suicide hanging by a binary tree.  

 

Other nerds were concerned, “Get her a girl” they said  
“Get someone to to love young, Man, get her to bed”  
“But I have no people skills” says he in dread  
“With higgs-boson on my mind, who’d take my head?”  

 

They thought and thought and thought of Anne,  
Finally, paid a hefty sum to make him a man.  
He met her at the bar according to plan  
Quoting the third law, his slibe began  

 

He went on all night like a machine in motion,  
Suddenly a realization in the middle of the commotion,  
He gathered his ideas got a hold of his notions.  
“Science is my bitch”, such was his mutation  

 

He pulled out in haste,all sore,  
admitting he had never had this much fun before.  
But he spilled H2SO4 on the two cent whore,  
And he ran and he ran, not to be seen any more.

This has to be read with caution. One might get too excited… Face it your friend won’t do this for you. This is a highly scientific issue that  befuddles the brightest young minds of the country.  It a tough choice, agreed. But Higgs Boson Would not have been discovers if peter higgs had not abandoned his family. This is perhaps his story, or the story of  every commonplace man of science.
