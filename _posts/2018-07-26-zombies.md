Are you born with a creed, a zombie in human skin  
swallowed whole by greed, blood ties water thin  
wasting time on discussion, building houses of sand  
wave come in how, sweat on your brow, nothing planned  

Four years on shrooms, the paper makes you tall  
But the elephant in the room, stomps around makes you small  
And you bleed on the paper cut, burdened by degrees    
It’s warm out, but you ‘re cold now, ready to freeze   


We are dreaming of no tomorrow We are living like no today  
We are drinking our sorrow We got nothing more to say  
We’re just a drop in the ocean, ‘nother brick in the wall    
Zombies in constant motion On the edge ready to brawl    
 
Learn the wisdom of the age, disillusioned by urge to fly  
Not know how big’s your cage, even birds are chained to the sky  
Shadows in the cave your reality, go turn off the lights  
Run along now, escape somehow, before it comes it bites  


We are dreaming of no sorrow We are living in sinking dismay  
We are drinking away tomorrow, nothing making us stay  
We’re just a drop in the ocean, another body in the gaul  
Zombies without emotion, On the edge ready to brawl  

 
The sun come up and it goes down  
The sun comes up and the earth goes around  
The son leaves home and is nowhere found  
The gun is clocked the clock is wound  


We are screaming out in horror, We are living like no today  
We are drinking away tomorrow We got demons to slay  
We’re just a drop in the ocean, ‘nother stick in the brawl  
Zombies without notion, on the edge ready to fall
