##### Art: Flower Garden by Gustav Klimt (1905)


**#1**  
Golden corona  
Sweet beer or deadly virus  
I want a haircut  

**#2**  
I'm bored, alone  
Hanging between life and death  
Hooked to iron lungs  

**#3**  
Wash! Rinse! Sanitize!  
Before you wipe away tears  
I just got laid off

**#4**  
Happiness erupts  
Seeing my newborn smile 
 Live on a zoom call

**#5**  
T-shirt for a mask  
I scrub the hospital floor  
Am I essential?  

**#6**  
The bank needs money  
Give me my stimulus check  
The church needs money


**#7**  
Give thoughts and prayers  
As I sell my private jet  
For greedy workers

**#8**  
Social distancing  
She stays two meters away  
Break up made easy


_I will keep updating this post!_
