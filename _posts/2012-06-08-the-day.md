I met Her one “fine” day;  
she said “I’m fine”, but her eyes doth betray.  
The blue dam held behind an ocean of tears;  
Sensing her pain i asked -” What’s the matter, Dear?”.  
But She said what seemed to be white lies;  
Finally, she could not hold back…she cried.  
I took her in my arms;  
Promised, i’ll protect her from all harms.  
But she said we were not meant to be….  
” it isin’t you….its me”.  
Hence, the classic hand had been played,   
I felt speechless and betrayed.  
the Sun was shining down on us, oh so bright;  
She began to retrace her steps, fading into the light.  
As our years together flashed by.  
i took a deep breath, forced a smile and said..”Goodbye”
