She danced on wet sand  
Blind to Apollo’s rite  
Wild like her neighbouring strand  
Much to Selene’s delight  
 
She is of the Elven folk  
Stolen stars adorn her ebony hair  
And ocean wove her a pearly cloak  
As she twirled without a care  

The argent salmon in candid motion  
Fills the water with cheer  
Silver shells echoing the ocean  
Adorn her pale white ear  

Even, Luna rose from her sterling bed  
And entered this mortal coil  
From each step moonlight bled  
As she swayed in her radiant voile  

Drunk on their rhythm divine  
The mariner doth sit and stare  
As the sea carries away this lover of mine  
Unaware, dance the pair
