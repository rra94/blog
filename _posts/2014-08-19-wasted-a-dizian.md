**A _Dizan_ is a traditional French poem composed of 10 lines with 8 syllables in each line. Later, however,  ten syllable lines were also used. A few examples of this form in England did prefer Iambic Pentameter, but that's purely up to the poet.**



Dizzy, I toiled in the harsh light  
My hands slowing as my heart paced  
Armed and stoned, I’m ready to smite  
Never had wine but bile I taste  
Holes in my soul too large to baste  
Now I lay on my earthly bed  
On the green cush I rest my head  
Warm sylvian breeze, cool me down  
Seal my wounds now, enough I’ve bled  
Cover my eyes, Dream, let me drown.
