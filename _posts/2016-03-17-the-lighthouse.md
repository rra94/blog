By the shore, I was waiting  
My feet deep in sand  
Braving these salty winds, aggravating  
My eyes shining, my arms fanned  

By the shore, I was waiting  
As waves slapped across my face    
Holding back tears, teeth grating    
Fear not my love, my back will brace    

By the shore, I was waiting   
For the sun to rise   
While it hid behind the clouds debating    
and sent the moon in its guise    

By the shore, I was waiting  
For my dearest, my shining knight    
like the stars my heart is pulsating  
slowly fading into the dawning light  

I still wait, by the shore  
As my light touches your lips  
Carrying on my eternal chore  
As the star guiding your ships
