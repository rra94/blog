Sun-lit morning neon night  
All my hours are blinding, bright  
I yearn for the dark cool cave  
Better, the warm earthly grave  

I shut my eyes, my eyelids glow red  
Maybe the light is inside my head  
Switch it off, pull it’s plug  
easier, gorge them off my ghastly mug  

Even my dreams have teeth, they bite  
Caged in my mind, in there they fight  
Rabid, hungry, feeding on my fears  
Their howl echos in my hollow ears  

I keep running to places yonder  
“Will I find peace here”, I wonder  
Lo! My conscience harbours cursed thoughts  
She bind my limbs with tight knots  

I lay in my bed awake all the time  
Full of poison, covered in grime  
Scared to go out, love my muse  
Craven and weak to don the noose  

Neither she comes to release me  
Nor death relaxes my weary bones  
Still I wait, unable to flee  
Ageing slowly in twilt zones
