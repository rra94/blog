As space behind your eyes fills up   
With lilac knights and silver tea cups  
My eyes are open and they see  
Folds of grey on a colourless sea  

As you dance on grass velvet green   
Skipping stones on lakes serene   
I am chained to a leafless tree  
Brackish water kisses my knee  

You stop you stoop, pick up a flower 
Pluck red apples, with gust you devour   
My back aches, my head sinks   
With every breath my belly shrinks  

You chase a doe, giggling with glee   
You catch it, kiss it, let it flee   
I struggle and the chain sinks deeper     
My hollow voice calls for the reaper  

Do stop for a moment, do you wonder   
Why this bliss, do you ponder?   
I clench my fist, try to dream    
Hatch a plan, cook up a scheme  

Afraid to leave you idyllic life   
You left me in eternal strife   
Wistful I am, call it wishful thinking   
The tree I’m tied to is slowly sinking  

Hold a shell close to your ear   
Feeble still, my voice you’ll hear   
Whisper a lullaby then throw it away   
With merciful currents, it’ll float my way  

Consider it payment for the ferry   
A song of assurance, you needn’t worry   
In crescendo, I call out your name   
If only you could do the the same
