_"Love is the answer_  
_And you know that for sure_  
_Love is a flower_  
_You gotta let it, you gotta let it grow"_  

Haters gonna hate but its true what John Lennon said, the world is built up on too much hate-we need love.

Coined by the hippie generation in the 1960's.This was the slogan that defined a generation of activists. For a few short years they threw themselves body and soul into changing countries. These young people called themselves a Movement, and they committed themselves to generating a Revolution. This revolution did nothing but claim lives and destroy lives. The phrase became popular during the time of demonstrations against the Vietnam War. Another saying from the time was "_What if they gave a war and nobody came_". Soon these sons of anarchy started to resort to religion. These conversions were not due to a crisis of meaning, but a crisis of means. The goals of these activists remained the same, and their commitment to changing the world remained just as strong. They converted because they believed they had found a better means of achieving their goals. In short, they concluded that the best way to change the world was to change themselves.

While originally it was a love thy neighbour type of saying it was soon used with the connotation of making sexual love, especially among those who would tune in, turn on, and drop out. Another example of a saying from the time that took on another meaning was the campaign slogan "_Nixon's the one_." Soon there were posters of a pregnant Lucy (from the Charlie Brown cartoon series) with a large round belly calling out "Nixon's the one.

“So what's better than resorting to sex, after all "_love is all you need?_” No one ever died from love. The world has braved two world wars namely World War 1 and World War 2 amongst other feuds. Not that fancy, I agree. But as H.G Wells said: "If we don't end war, war will end us." While "love" does the exact opposite, it creates more of us. What we tend to do is we do not care for this metaphorical flower and let it grow into the "weed" that chokes our own sustenance. Weed hmm... that's interesting, that's one of the things fueling the Movement and perhaps the hippies.

Following the eccentric whims of nuclear powers like North Korea, the growth of terrorism in form of Al Qaeda, and the arrogance of Uncle Sam; the world is being forced into another cold war, an arms race which could culminate into a nuclear holocaust. While excessive love only adds to the pain of our ailing Earth as it carries the burden of its 7 billion human inhabitants. So can’t make love, can’t make war what do we do? Contraceptives could help perhaps. Jokes apart, we must understand the profound meaning of the statement. Lennon wanted us to “Imagine” he wanted peace. Sure he was a high hippy but he had the best intentions at heart, after all
