In tandem we jumped off  
got suspended in ether  
losing track of time kept talking  
’till we fell for each other  

We landed in the garden green  
of bluebirds’ songs and honey sweet  
ignored the world as we talked  
about purring cats and dancing trees  

Autumn came on a windy day  
On it’s wings you wanted to fly  
Mute I watched from the brown below  
As it carried your words away  

Alas winter brought it’s blanket white  
even the jolly bear caught his sleep  
lazy, bored maybe ignored  
we did not talk any more  

I wish spring would soon come  
wash over your pretty face  
I yearn to see your lips twitching  
There is so much to talk about
