Sitting in his golden nation  
Laments the Pale King  
Swimming in quite isolation  
No straws left to cling  

He walks empty halls  
Decked with epicurean sights  
In fields of Elysium no bird calls  
Pleasure chambers empty, no delights  

His aides sung praises  
Singeing his aged bones  
Deaf to their flattering phrases  
On the rocky shore he bemoans:  

Shoulder buried under a crimson cape  
My ivory crown resemble horn  
Death’s kiss I do escape  
Children I father are never born  

Bleak thoughts surround me  
My dreams are long dead   
I have no one around me  
I live inside my own head  

“Look the water recedes in fear”  
“… as I touch it” he roared  
Sullen waters foamed and drew near  
pushing back his grovelling horde  

Kneel not to clay he bade  
As he bowed his lofty crest  
Laughing, drew his silver blade  
And ended this worldly quest
