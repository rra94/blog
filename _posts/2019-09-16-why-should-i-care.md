Why should I care?   
About the shirts you pick  
About the clothes I wear  

You didn’t, back then  
as we pranced around  
starlit, skin bare  


Why should I care?  
On how your day went  
What’s right, what’s fair  

We didn’t, back then  
pain was superfluous  
silly an affair  

Why should I care?   
That we’re in public    
silently let them stare   

I didn’t, back then   
when we kissed    
As you caressed my hair   

Why should I care?  
That you love me still    
but you can’t be here    

I do too, as back then  
till my heart beats  
and lungs fill with air
