Iwoke up in a land of Dreams,  
No, not the one with a fairytale theme.  
T’was a dark desolate place, where the devil doth roam,   
Where on profanity, lust and greed doth men clomb.   
There was no one but me shadow as a friend,  
As I roamed about this emptiness – hungry, tried à wits end.   
Suddenly the air chilled, sky darkened and my shadow flew,  
A fiend appeared with crimson eyes and skin a deadly shade of blue.  
As the monster looked me in the eyes,  
I knew it was Fate in disguise.  
The life I had lived flashed moments apart,  
Quanta of emotions exploded in my heart.  
I said – “If this be the end i don’t want thee,  
The ferryman will have to leave without his fee”.  
I struck the beast hard never realizing His plan,   
It was me that died as It was slain.  
Everything was blurry as I opened my eyes,  
I didn’t have glasses on, I realized  
I put them on to see a familiar scene,  
A ransacked room and a bright LED screen.  
I had dozed off playing the Game,  
Stuck on some level – what a shame!    
Realizing – such similar is the strife,  
Call it a game, Call it Life.
