The sky twists and turns  
Like a sleepless convict in sin   
In passion she too churns   
Awaiting her heathen  

in turmoil she cries   
“I long my man in blue”   
Her heart treasures disguise     
Her siren song ringing true  

In his belly thunder surges   
On his face flashes charm   
“shoot for the moon he urges”   
"Lest, fall in my starry arm"  

Every meeting’s bittersweet   
Revel and rejoice   
Some in tears meet   
Many don’t get the choice  

There is silver lining to this story   
Icy snow melts to rain   
The earth is green with envy   
Unbeknownst the lovers’ pain  

Happy lovers unite   
Apollo smiles over the horizon   
Amused by the quotidian rite   
Infinite cycles warms his vision  

Helpless she calls her ferry man   
His sleep unperturbed and sound  
Where one meeting’s divine plan   
Another union is never found
