She would desire a gift   
The day of passion is nigh.   
To save the river running dry   
To fill this seeping rift   
Turning stones, he doth drift   
But what can this pauper buy?     
He fogs the window with his sigh   
For the smith is unfazed by his thrift.   
So hidden within, curtains drew   
From the shores of his empty cot   
On paper white and cursive blue 
He carved a flowing “you”  
With a heart over the I’s dot   
Colored it with love true
