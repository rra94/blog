With mirth they seem’d be laughing  
but had a smile seared instead.  
With pain abraded and sadness in place,  
Is happiness in your head?  


with heads held low and stinging rays of hope    
faith grows heavy as lead.  
The coal is wet and the brazier grows cold,  
Is happiness still in your head?  

The urge to do is done away with  
the pyre burns and the forest, in dread.  
The vision goes bleary and senses askew  
Happiness can’t be in your head.  

Will the fog fade and the obscured sky be clear?  
When will the the truth be told, the petitions be read?  
Will the promises ever be kept, them songs be sung?  
Happiness is in your head?
