On a summer day, in May     
You said you were going away     
“Where?”, I ask, you smile “    
I’ll be gone, only for a while”    

Azul summers faded to white    
Five hundred days turned into night    
I stood still as the earth spun    
Under your spell, unable to run    

I jumped high, I dove deep   
I took pills to help me sleep   
Time healed, and dulled the pain   
Till they mentioned you again  

Did I miss you, you ask   
Looking through my flimsy mask   
“I used to”, still beguiled   
“But I haven’t, for a while”  

Now there is someone who   
Loves me more than I loved you   
I wish I could rip my heart in two   
Lo, I’d give the bigger piece to you  

Incapable to love I am   
I know ’tis is but a sham   
Do I even deserve love true?   
Yet I ask, do you?
