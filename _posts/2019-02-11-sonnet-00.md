My first half hearted attempt at a sonnet.


Do your words have any meaning?  
By the strand on starry nights, I ponder.   
Songs of love, on silly couplets time I squander   
As I recite them oft, like a peafowl preening   
Oblivious to your vile screening.   
“Do you hold me dear?” Is all I wonder    
Besotted by me? Who knows only to wander.   
Was my passion but madness weaning?   
For did you not toss me that rose?   
As my song kissed your ears   
Did you not blow kisses and smile?   
Wet roseate cheeks, what were those?   
Serpent of the Nile shedding reptilian tears?   
Or just a cruel hearted jest at my exile.
