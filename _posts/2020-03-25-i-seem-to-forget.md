*Trying out some experimental stuff so bear with me.*

***

I seem to forget The colour of your hair   
Was it short with a streak of blue  
Or was it green on brown  
Like the last day of summer  

I try to recall   
Your favourite dress   
Is that what was blue, like Monet's lilies     
Or was it yellow like Van Gogh's flowers   


I do remember a park bench  
Was that a yellow straw hat you wore?   
I forget if we held hands   
Did you kiss me?  

Did we walk or did we sit?    
Did you smell like Easter lilies?    
I think you were talking   
But I never listened  


There are so many things I don't remember    
Many more I want to forget   
Somethings are about the person you were    
Others, about the person I am
