Who teaches you to smile?  

Is it your mother?  
Shielding you from the cold winds  
like mountains of snow  

Or her mother?  
Who reveals a gummy cave  
Having lived long enough to not care  

Could be the one across the table?  
Who hides mischief  
behind a curtain of white  

Or is it you?  
Flexing your lips in front of the mirror  
Just trying to fit in  

For me, it’s unfamiliar eyes  
Who recognise something  
I couldn’t hide
