Where do you go,  
When you close your eyes    
Do you dream of snow?    
Do you see clear blue skies     

Does your little toe curl    
In the warm sand  
Do your slender hips twirl   
fists clenched or fingers fanned?    

With wings spread,    
Flying over yellow veins    
What thoughts race in your head     
As you soar above grassy plains    

Do you rest on a frozen lake   
Or glide over the electric ice    
Does it melt, does it flake?   
or just whet your silly vice  
 
Do you pray for summer rain   
Does it allay your eternal thirst    
Is all thatâ€™s verdant, vain?    
Green Leaves, forever cursed   

What do your closed eyes seek   
In vales, peaks and oceans deep   
Is it the pink of your pale cheek   
Or a moment of unperturbed sleep?  

Is it the touch of one dear?   
On your back laid bare   
Is it the emptiness you fear?   
Or the inability to share   

I wish you go to a happy place   
With sugary smell of morning dew  
Pearls glittering on your pretty face   
I wish to be there with you
